  /**
   * `<variables-evaluator>` Variables evaluator for the Advanced REST Client
   *
   * The element listens for `before-request` custom event and evaluates its
   * properties. This element is responsible for applying variables to the request.
   *
   * This elements works with `variables-manager`. When evaluation has been requested
   * it asks the manager for list of current variables. After the list is evaluated
   * then the requested value is evaluated for the variables.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```html
   * <variables-evaluator></variables-evaluator>
   * ```
   *
   * A value can be evaluated on demand by dispatching `evaluate-variable` custom
   * event. It will perform evaluation on the `value` property of the detail object.
   * The element adds a `result` property to the detail object which is a Promise
   * that resolves to a value.
   * The event is cancelled and it's propagation is stopped so other evaluators won't
   * perform the same task again.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```javascript
   * // requesting to create an environment
   * const e = new CustomEvent('evaluate-variable', {
   *    bubbles: true,
   *    composed: true,
   *    cancelable: true,
   *    detail: {
   *      value: 'The timestamp is now() and generating random() value'
   *    }
   * });
   * document.dispatchEvent(e);
   * console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // true
   * e.detail.result.then(function(value) {
   *    console.log(value);
   * })
   * .catch(function(cause) {
   *    console.log(cause.message);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Changes in 2.0
   *
   * Jexl is now optional dependency. Install it from other sources and include into
   * the web app. The web component version is offered by `advanced-rest-client/Jexl#^2.0.0`.
   * Node version can be installed from `npm install jexl --save`.
   * This prevents double inclusion in Electron environment.
